# Thesis - Augmented Reality Serious Game for Intelligent Wheelchair

## About the project

The quality of life of people with reduced mobility is an important matter and every day technology also evolves in order to help them. Intelligent wheelchairs are a result of this evolution, however, adapting to use new technologies is not always easy. Serious games can make the process of acquiring the skills to use a robotic wheelchair a fun and immersive method. Augmented reality is also a support tool in learning and training how to use several new technologies, including robotics. Allowing the visualization and interaction with virtual objects in the environment which the intelligent wheelchair is inserted, augmented reality make the creation of a serious game possible. Consequently, in this dissertation we developed an augmented reality serious game, taking advantage of ARCore’s tracking capabilities, which were studied and evaluated. A tool for configuring the augmented reality environment where the serious game is played has been developed. The game is supported by a visualization tool that, at the end, allows the visualization of the user’s performance and his errors. An experiment to evaluate the configuration tool and the serious game was carried out with the collaboration of a set of participants. In addition to the development of the serious game and the tools necessary to make it possible, we also developed a library which allows transforming Unity games into augmented reality games.
